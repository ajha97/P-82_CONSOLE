            <h2>VISUAL STUDIO</h2>
            <p>
                Microsoft Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) from Microsoft. It is used to develop computer programs, as well as websites, web apps, web services and mobile apps. Visual Studio uses Microsoft software development platforms such as Windows API, Windows Forms, Windows Presentation Foundation, Windows Store and Microsoft Silverlight. It can produce both native code and managed code.

Visual Studio includes a code editor supporting IntelliSense (the code completion component) as well as code refactoring. The integrated debugger works both as a source-level debugger and a machine-level debugger. Other built-in tools include a code profiler, designer for building GUI applications, web designer, class designer, and database schema designer. It accepts plug-ins that expand the functionality at almost every levelâ€”including adding support for source control systems (like Subversion and Git) and adding new toolsets like editors and visual designers for domain-specific languages or toolsets for other aspects of the software development lifecycle (like the Azure DevOps client: Team Explorer).

Visual Studio supports 36 different programming languages and allows the code editor and debugger to support (to varying degrees) nearly any programming language, provided a language-specific service exists. Built-in languages include C, C++, C++/CLI, Visual Basic .NET, C#, F#, JavaScript, TypeScript, XML, XSLT, HTML, and CSS. Support for other languages such as Python, Ruby, Node.js, and M among others is available via plug-ins. Java (and J#) were supported in the past.

The most basic edition of Visual Studio, the Community edition, is available free of charge. The slogan for Visual Studio Community edition is "Free, fully-featured IDE for students, open-source and individual developers".

As of 8 November 2021 the current production-ready Visual Studio version was 2022, with older versions such as 2013 and 2015 on Extended Support, and 2017 and 2019 on Mainstream Support.

            <h2>CONSOLE SCREEN</h2>
            <p>
                A user typically interacts with a console application using only a keyboard and display screen,
                 as opposed to GUI applications, which normally require the use of a mouse or other pointing device.
                  Many console applications such as command line interpreters are command line tools, but numerous 
                  text-based user interface (TUI) programs also exist.

As the speed and ease-of-use of GUIs applications have improved over time, the use of console applications has greatly 
 diminished, but not disappeared. Some users simply prefer console based applications, while some organizations still 
 rely on existing console applications to handle key data processing tasks.

The ability to create console applications is kept as a feature of modern programming environments such as Visual Studio 
and the .NET Framework on Microsoft Windows.[3] It simplifies the learning process of a new programming language by 
removing the complexity of a graphical user interface (see an example in the C# article).

For data processing tasks and computer administration, these programming environments represent the next level of 
operating system or data processing control after scripting. If an application is only going to be run by the original 
programmer and/or a few colleagues, there may be no need for a pretty graphical user interface, leaving the application 
leaner, faster and easier to maintain.
